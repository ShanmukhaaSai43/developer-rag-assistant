| Sat on | Week 4 · Monday |
| Marks | 100 |


## 1. Problem statement

The test kitchen just handed you 6 new recipe cards from the fermentation chapter, and each one is a structured ingredient table (ingredient, weight, baker's percentage) followed by loose method prose and an allergen note. Your RAG app already indexes the old cards, but nobody has checked whether your current chunker keeps '7g fine sea salt' attached to the recipe it belongs to. Work against your existing pipeline: ingest the drop, measure two chunking strategies on questions you already know the answers to, and make the app refuse what it cannot source.


---

## 2. Requirements

1. Ingest the 6 supplied recipe cards into your existing index with metadata on every chunk: source_file, recipe_id, cuisine, dietary_tags. A chunk with no source_file is a failed ingest.
2. Write 8 questions whose answers you already know and can point to by recipe and section (at least 3 must depend on a row inside an ingredient table, e.g. the exact salt weight for the 2kg sourdough or the hydration percentage).
3. Index the same 6 cards under TWO chunking strategies — your current one, and a structure-aware one that never separates an ingredient row from its table header or its parent recipe title. Run all 8 questions search-only against both and report hit-in-top-5 as a number out of 8 for each. Two strategies, two numbers, same 8 questions.
4. Add a metadata filter on dietary_tags and show one query where filtering changes the top-1 result. Paste both result lists (unfiltered and filtered) with scores.
5. Run 3 answerable questions through generation with a citation per claim that resolves to a real chunk_id and recipe, and 3 questions your corpus cannot answer (e.g. a nutrition macro breakdown that appears on no card) that must be refused rather than invented.
6. Time reality: do NOT re-index your whole recipe corpus. Index the 6 new cards only, and say so in your write-up.

## 3. Expected output

A results.md containing: the 8 questions with their known-correct recipe/section, a table of hit-in-top-5 for both chunking strategies (X/8 each), the unfiltered vs filtered result lists for one query, 3 cited answers with clickable/resolvable chunk_ids, 3 refusal transcripts, and one paragraph naming which chunking strategy you are keeping and why. Plus the code diff and the search-only dump for all 8 questions under both strategies.

## 4. Evaluation rubric

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Two hit-in-top-5 numbers over the SAME 8 known-answer questions, per-question record shown, not a summary claim | 30 |
| Metadata filter demonstrably changing retrieval, with both result lists and scores pasted | 20 |
| Citations resolve to real chunk_ids and the cited chunk actually contains the claim (grader will check one) | 20 |
| All 3 out-of-corpus questions honestly refused, with the refusal transcripts pasted | 20 |
| Written defended chunking choice plus one documented retrieval that embarrassed you, with its diagnosis | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

*Zero points for polish, UI, or "it works". This mirrors the House rubric: failure-finding and a number that moved are what score.*

## 5. Bonus challenge

Find a question where the structure-aware chunker WINS on retrieval but LOSES on the final answer, because the tight ingredient-row chunk retrieves precisely and then gives the model no method prose to explain when the salt goes in. Show both answers side by side and write two sentences on the precision/completeness tension.


---

## 6. Submission checklist

- [ ] results.md with all 8 questions and their known-correct recipe + section
- [ ] The two hit-in-top-5 numbers (X/8 and Y/8) in one table
- [ ] Unfiltered vs filtered result lists for one dietary_tags query, with scores
- [ ] 3 cited answers + 3 refusal transcripts pasted verbatim
- [ ] Code diff showing the second chunker and the metadata fields
- [ ] One paragraph: which chunker ships, and why


---

## 7. Common mistakes

- **Writing the 8 questions AFTER looking at what retrieval returns — then your hit-rate measures your question-writing, not your chunker. Write the questions from the cards first, then run search.**
- **Changing the chunker AND swapping the embedding model in the same run, then reporting one number — two changes means you learn nothing about which one moved it.**
- **Judging chunking by eyeballing the retrieved text and saying it 'looks better'. Looks-better is not a number and scores zero here.**
- **Letting the grounding prompt say 'if the context is insufficient, use your best judgement' — that sentence is exactly how an invented gram weight ends up in a reader's dough. The refusal must be forced, not suggested.**
- **Re-indexing the entire recipe corpus and running out of time at minute 45 with no measurement at all. The measurement is the deliverable; the ingest is plumbing.**

*Set B of 6. Sets A–F are equivalent in difficulty and objectives; only the domain differs.*
